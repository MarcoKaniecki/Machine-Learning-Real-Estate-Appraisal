# Using Machine Learning for Real Estate Appraisal
Before starting, make sure you have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), pip (comes with python3), and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) installed.

## Local Installation
Find or create a directory where you want to store the repo

```console
git clone https://github.com/MarcoKaniecki/Machine-Learning-Real-Estate-Appraisal
```

```console
cd Machine-Learning-Real-Estate-Appraisal
```
## Running with Launcher (Windows Only)
Running 'WindowsLauncher.py' within the top level of the repository will run all necessary steps to run the server, open data in Django database, and frontend webpage. You will still need to follow the steps to setup and configure the Comps database manually.
Please note that you will have to refresh http://127.0.0.1:8000 after the script runs in order to see the data.
If you run into issues using this or you are using a different OS, see the manual steps below.
